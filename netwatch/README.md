# Netwatch

**Network traffic monitoring with threat detection**

## Project Goal

Netwatch provides real-time monitoring of network traffic, detecting anomalies and potential threats to help maintain network health and security.

## Key Features

- Monitor incoming and outgoing traffic on interfaces
- Detect suspicious patterns and potential attacks
- Generate logs and alerts for critical events
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- CLI interface for automation and integration

## Usage

```sh
jbang netwatch/Netwatch.java --interface eth0
jbang netwatch/Netwatch.java --alert-level medium
```

## Example Use Cases

- Continuous monitoring of network interfaces in enterprise environments
- Automated alerting on suspicious traffic signatures
- Integrate with sysmon for a unified monitoring solution

## Configuration

- No external dependencies required (runs with JBang)
- Command-line flags for interface selection, alert levels, and logging

## Contribution

- Fork the repo and submit pull requests
- See PROMPT.md for LLM and pair programming guidelines
- Issues and feature requests welcome!

## Ecosystem Integration

Netwatch can be used with:
- `sysmon` for full system monitoring
- `filewatch` for correlating file events with network activity
- `jobops` for securing network-based applications
