# Procman

**Advanced process manager with AI recommendations**

## Project Goal

Procman provides command-line tools for managing system processes with AI-driven recommendations, enabling prioritized control, resource allocation, and automation of routine tasks.

## Key Features

- List, start, stop, and kill processes
- AI-based suggestions for resource optimization
- Monitor CPU and memory usage per process
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- CLI interface for scripting and integration

## Usage

```sh
jbang procman/Procman.java --list
jbang procman/Procman.java --kill 12345
jbang procman/Procman.java --recommend
```

## Example Use Cases

- Identify and terminate resource-hungry processes
- Automate process prioritization based on AI recommendations
- Integrate with sysmon for continuous system health management

## Configuration

- No external dependencies required (runs with JBang)
- Command-line flags for operations, monitoring intervals, and AI modes

## Contribution

- Fork the repo and submit pull requests
- See PROMPT.md for LLM and pair programming guidelines
- Issues and feature requests welcome!

## Ecosystem Integration

Procman can be used with:
- `sysmon` for unified system monitoring and management
- `pertun` for automated performance tuning of critical processes
- `jobops` for managing AI job processes
