# Servicectl

**System service manager with predictive failure detection**

## Project Goal

Servicectl provides command-line tools to manage system services (start, stop, enable) and uses predictive analysis to detect potential service failures before they occur.

## Key Features

- List, start, stop, and enable system services
- Predictive failure detection using ML models
- Monitoring and health checks
- Cross-platform support (Windows services, Linux systemd)
- CLI interface for automation and scripting

## Usage

```sh
jbang servicectl/Servicectl.java --list
jbang servicectl/Servicectl.java --enable apache2
jbang servicectl/Servicectl.java --predict
```

## Example Use Cases

- Automate service management in CI/CD pipelines
- Predict and prevent critical service outages
- Integrate with sysmon for unified monitoring dashboards

## Configuration

- No external dependencies required (runs with JBang)
- Command-line flags for operations, predictive thresholds, and service filters

## Contribution

- Fork the repo and submit pull requests
- See PROMPT.md for LLM and pair programming guidelines
- Issues and feature requests welcome!

## Ecosystem Integration

Servicectl can be used with:
- `sysmon` for system-wide monitoring and alerts
- `netguard` for security-based service predictions
- `jobops` for ensuring AI services are up before use
